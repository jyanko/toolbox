## Painting Your Tools Blue

To make your tools stand out, we recommend painting them blue using high heat blue engine spray paint. Here's how:

### Materials Needed
- High heat blue engine spray paint (recommended for durability)
- Drop cloth or newspaper
- Masking tape (for areas you don't want painted)
- Safety equipment (gloves, mask, goggles)
- Well-ventilated area

### Instructions
1. **Prepare the workspace**: Lay down drop cloth in a well-ventilated area
2. **Clean tools**: Remove any dirt, grease, or rust from tool surfaces
3. **Mask off areas**: Use masking tape to protect any parts that shouldn't be painted (rubber grips, measurement markings, etc.)
4. **Apply paint**: Hold spray can 6-8 inches from surface and apply in thin, even coats
5. **Dry between coats**: Wait 10-15 minutes between coats, apply 2-3 coats for best coverage
6. **Cure time**: Allow 24 hours for paint to fully cure before using tools

### Why Blue?
Blue tools stand out in a crowded toolbox and are less likely to be borrowed (and not returned) by colleagues!
